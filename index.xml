We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>About Hugo</title><link>https://example.com/about-hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/about-hugo/</guid><description>Hugo is the world’s fastest framework for building websites.

This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://example.com/posts/hugoisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/posts/hugoisforlovers/</guid><description>Step 1.

Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item></channel></rss>
