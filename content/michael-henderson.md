Hi there, my name is Michael Henderson. I'm a passionate photographer and programmer with a love for adventure and the great outdoors. When I'm not coding or snapping photos, you can find me cruising around town on my bike, exploring new trails and enjoying the fresh air. I'm always looking for opportunities to combine my interests and capture beautiful moments through my camera lens. Nice to meet you!
